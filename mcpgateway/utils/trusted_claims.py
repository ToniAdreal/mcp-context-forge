Trusted claims extraction and group-to-team resolution (issues #5899, #5976).

This module maps a verified external-IdP JWT payload to a virtual principal
per the pinned trust-mode contract. It also hosts the group-mapping resolver,
the group-overage marker detector shared with the SSO enrichment path, and
the overage policy dispatch (:func:`resolve_overage_groups`, issue #5977).

Claim readers support dotted paths one or more levels deep (for example the
Keycloak ``realm_access.roles`` shape). Each path segment must name a JSON
object member; traversal through arrays or scalar values is not supported and
resolves to "claim absent". A missing optional claim yields the field
default; a missing required claim is an extraction error.

PRINCIPAL CONTRACT (VirtualPrincipal):

- ``user_id``: required, opaque string. Read from the claim named by
  ``jwt_claim_user_id``. No UUID heuristic applies in trust mode. A missing
  mapped claim raises an extraction error with 401 semantics; the value never
  defaults to the email claim.
- ``email``: optional, None allowed. Read from the claim named by
  ``jwt_claim_email``. Audit-path writes degrade to the ``"unknown"``
  sentinel string (never None) because ``AuditTrail.user_id`` is
  ``nullable=False``; ``ObservabilityTrace.user_email`` is nullable and
  accepts None. See :attr:`VirtualPrincipal.audit_identity`.
- ``full_name``: optional, default None. Read from the ``name`` claim.
- ``teams``: normalized list of team ID strings. The claim named by
  ``jwt_claim_teams`` accepts a list of strings or a list of ``{id, name}``
  mappings, mirroring ``normalize_token_teams`` in ``auth_context.py``.
  Mapped team IDs from the external-group resolver are appended. External
  group IDs never enter ``teams`` directly. When every external group is
  unmapped and the token carries no teams claim, ``teams`` is ``[]``
  (public-only access; the principal still authenticates).
- ``roles``: list of role names. The claim named by ``jwt_claim_roles``
  merges with role names returned by the group-mapping resolver before
resolution. Each name resolves scope-exactly to exactly one active row
  in the server-side ``roles`` table via
  ``mcpgateway.services.role_resolution.resolve_mapping_role`` (team scope
  preferred, global fallback, lowest id, rows never unioned); permissions
  are never embedded in or read from the token. Names with no active row
  are ignored with a WARNING log (fail-closed). When the mapped admin
  claim is true, ``"platform_admin"`` is appended by the server (atomic
  admin mapping, #5902) after roles-table validation, so it can never be
  dropped as unknown.
- ``is_admin``: bool, default False. Read from the claim named by
  ``jwt_claim_admin`` and parsed strictly: only ``True``, ``1``, and the
  case-insensitive strings ``"true"``/``"1"``/``"yes"`` grant admin; every
  other value (including the truthy-coercing strings ``"false"``/``"0"``
  /``"no"``) is non-admin. A present but non-canonical value logs one
  structured warning naming the claim and its JSON type, never the value.
  A missing claim is silently non-admin (fail-closed).
- ``auth_provider``: the token issuer (``iss``) when present, else the
  string ``"jwt-trust"``.
- ``token_use``: the constant string ``"trusted"``.

Revocation: the claim named by ``jwt_trust_revocation_claim`` (default
``jti``; ``uti`` supported for Entra trust roots) is the revocation
identifier. A trust-eligible token missing the configured claim is rejected
with 401 semantics.
